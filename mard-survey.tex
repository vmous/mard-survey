\begin{abstract}
Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems is a rapidly growing application architecture. The
overlay network abstraction on top of a best-effort infrastructure provides a
powerful tool to realize a plethora of ever-wanted exotic features like
anonymity, high availability and robustness, load balancing, quality-of-service
(QoS) at the application layer and many more. Unfortunately weaknesses of early
effectuations constrained applications from unleashing the full potential of the
paradigm. One of them is the topology mismatch problem between the overlay and
the physical underlying network, a problem that imposes a huge amount of
unnecessary stress to the network resources and, thus, impede applications from
scaling. In this survey we investigate on the recent research developments
towards the alleviation of this problem, in both unstructured and structured
overlay architectures. We visit the various algorithms available in the
lietrature, focusing on the presentation of how each of them tries to tackle the
problem. Additionally, we provide a finer grained categorisation of the
approaches based on the generic type of methodology they use in order to
accomplish this goal.
% TODO: Review this after the comparison sections are fixed.
Finally we discuss the advantages, disadvantages and novelties introduced by the
algotithms and offer pictorial comparisons for them in order to further
strengthen and organise understanding of the information and knowledge cited, in
an attempt to make this survey a one-stop-shop reference for anyone interested
in the topic, from researchers and students, to system architects and
developers.

% \item Proximity Neighbour Selection\\
%Finally, the third approach, constructs the routing tables using proximity
%knowledge. Tapestry and Pastry's mechanisms of routing table
%maintenance try to minimize the distance to nodes appearing in a peer's routing
%table. Since routing is based on longest node ID prefix match, messages 
%are gradually forwarded to nearby nodes at each routing step.
%\cite{castro_proximityp2p_2002} argues on how Pastry exploits proximity
%neighbour selection in order to create a scheme that is (more) location-aware
%compared to the other well-known DHTs (CAN, Chord).

% TODO: SOME INFORMATION ON ISP-ASSISTED TOPOLOGY AWARENESS
%       ATTENTION: NEEDS REWORDING
%
% P4P [16],instead, aimed to provide a general framework for P2P
%applications by developing ISP-application interfaces so that
%application software can use the network layer information,
%such as congestion status and network topology, for better
%performance and resource utilization.

%P4P [37] project attempts to address
%the problem through custom trackers, both for ISPs and P2P
%systems, using an interface based on a primal-dual decomposition
%of an optimization problem. This interface design simplifies
%the realization of traffic-engineering objectives from each partiesâ€™
%perspective and ensures the extensibility of the approach. Through
%simulation-based studies and limited experimental deployments,
%these collaborative approaches have been shown to effectively
%reduce network costs while minimally impacting application performance.
%A clear advantage of these proposals is that they
%allow ISPs to incorporate aggregated traffic policies in their tracker
%recommendations (e.g., a particular traffic balance ratio between
%peering providers). However, all of them require deployments
%of oracles for each participating ISP and their effectiveness is
%ultimately predicated on their adoption by P2P applications and a
%trust relationship between P2P users and their ISPs.
