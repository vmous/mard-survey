The main objective of the manuscript is to offer a comprehensive treatment on how designers of peer-to-peer systems and respective applications have attempted to address the topology mismatch of the overlay with the actual network upon which such systems operate.

The problem of topology mismatch is clearly defined for peer-to-peer overlay architectures and the techniques used by both unstructured and structured systems to deal with topology mismatch are surveyed.

In depth and comprehensive comparison among the numerous analyzed techniques are provided an in this manner, a solid reference for developers, system architects and researchers in the field is furnished.
