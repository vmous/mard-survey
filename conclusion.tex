\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

Research and development in applications and systems that follow the 
\p\ architectural paradigm have flourished for more than a decade now.
By and large, such artifacts exploit the loose-coupling and self-organization 
of participating nodes to shape substrates upon which diverse applications 
can run; the latter offer services including, but not limited to, 
distributed naming, 
Internet telephony and video conferencing, 
storage and indexing, 
content and file sharing, 
web crawling and caching, 
event notification and subscribing/publishing.

These services are provided atop the 
best-effort infrastructure of today's Internet 
and they have to effectively deal with an array of key quality attributes that
they may have to offer, such as node availability, robustness,
scalability, load-sharing, quality-of-service and user anonymity.

The difficulty to handle such features effectively, emanates from the fact that
peer nodes operate at the edge of the Internet and no adequate attention 
is paid to the structure of the physical network during the 
network formation at the application-level.
The deviation of the distributed logically-formed overlay from the 
physical network yields suboptimal use of the underlying 
infrastructure and is known as the topology mismatch
problem.

Development of \p--systems and applications
typically involve juggling a set of tradeoffs (e.g.,
choosing higher accuracy at the cost of increased system overhead).
% Computer systems design is typically about juggling a set of tradeoffs (e.g.,
% choosing higher accuracy at the cost of increased system overhead.)  
In surveying more than
a decade's worth of research efforts aimed at solving the topology mismatch
problem in both unstructured and structured \p\ networks, we find this
tussle-of-tradeoffs property to hold.  
With regards to the three criteria we used --efficiency,
overhead, and scalability-- we find that none of the proposed solutions 
is superior to the others on all three fronts.  This is not surprising.
Nonetheless, by
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape i\upshape)]
  \item presenting an analysis of each of the solutions,
including what distinguishes it from 
others as well as its advantages and disadvantages and 
  \item offering a pictorial
comparison of how each solution fares in regards to others as far as
efficiency, overhead, and scalability are concerned,
\end{inparaenum}
we hope to have provided \p\
developers and researchers with enough insight and perspective;
as they face specific problems, they will be readily able to 
draw the best possible design decisions for their own application
environments.
